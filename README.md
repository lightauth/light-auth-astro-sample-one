![LightAuth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lightauth/.github/refs/heads/main/images/light-auth.svg) [Light Auth](https://lightauth.github.io) is a lightweight authentication solution designed for simplicity and ease of integration.

It provides essential authentication features with minimal configuration, making it ideal for small projects, prototypes, or applications that require straightforward user sign-in functionality.

## Astro Sample

This sample demonstrates how to integrate Light Auth with an Astro project.

You'll find examples of secure route protection, user session management, and simple login flowsâ€”all implemented using Astro's file-based routing and component system.

Explore the code to see how authentication logic is handled in Astro endpoints and how user state is managed across pages.
